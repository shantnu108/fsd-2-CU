# Experiment No: 11

# Title: Develop Microservice-Based Backend Module

---

##  Aim

To design and implement a microservice-based backend architecture using Flask, where independent services communicate to perform operations such as fetching customer orders and updating order status.

---

## Description

This experiment demonstrates a Microservices Architecture by developing two independent backend services:

1. **Customer Service** – Fetches customer details along with their orders  
2. **Order Service** – Manages and updates order data  

Each service runs independently and communicates via HTTP requests, showcasing loose coupling and service-to-service communication.

---

##  Functional Requirements

- Create Customer Service API to:
  - Fetch customer details  
  - Retrieve associated orders from Order Service  

- Create Order Service API to:
  - Fetch orders by user ID  
  - Update order status  

- Ensure:
  - Data is stored in in-memory variables  
  - Services communicate using REST APIs  
  - APIs are tested using Postman  

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python  
- Flask  
- REST APIs  
- JSON  
- HTTP Protocol  
- Postman (API Testing)  
- Render (Deployment)  

---

##  Features Implemented

- Microservice-based architecture  
- Inter-service communication using HTTP requests  
- RESTful API design  
- In-memory data storage  
- Error handling (service failure, invalid user)  
- Order status update functionality  
- API testing using Postman  
- Deployment on cloud platform
