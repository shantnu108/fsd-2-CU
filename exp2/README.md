# SPA Experiment – React + Vite

## Objective
To design and develop a basic Single Page Application (SPA) using a modern frontend framework and understand client-side rendering.

## Description
This project is a basic Single Page Application developed using **React** and **Vite**.
The application consists of multiple pages such as Home, About, Contact, and SPA, which are rendered dynamically without reloading the browser.

The project demonstrates component-based architecture and smooth navigation in SPAs.
It is successfully deployed on **Netlify**.
